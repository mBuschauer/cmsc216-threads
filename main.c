	TODO: Report - Run experiments where you explore the impact of threads while computing the maximum
	value and the sum. Create a table where you increase the number of threads and the data sets. Your
	goal is to see whether using additional threads improves performance. Provide a short (one paragraph)
	explanation of your results. You will NOT be penalize if you donâ€™t see any improvement while using
	threads. Just try to explain why. Write your report in a pdf file named report.pdf.
